# reen-rootfs
Repository for building rootfs tarballs for the Reen WSL Distribution. 

## about reen 
Reen is a customized WSL Distribution (based on Oracle Linux 8) for working with MS Azure. This Distribution is produced by my desire to have a WSL Distribution at hand that meet my needs during my work with MS Azure.

There are no plans to submit this Distribution to the Windows Store as this project is currently only driven by my own requirements and I dont see a lot of people finding use for this. If you do however want to try it I welcome you to use it.

I plan to migrate this Distribution to Rocky Linux as soon as the first stable releases appear.

## reen resources & installation
A second repository to store the assets that are being used with WSL Distribution. The resource repository also holds installation instructions for those who dont know how to use the releases procuded by this repository.
